      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.” – Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Engineers often bury themselves in code and the technical aspects of their work, which makes total sense, but every company&#xA;has a built-in rhythm for checking in on your performance, rewarding you with pay bumps or equity, and moving you up the ladder.&#xA;Think of these cycles (compensation reviews, stock refreshes, promotion windows) not as bureaucratic hoops,&#xA;but as regular checkpoints: &lt;strong&gt;do your goals still match what the company needs?&lt;/strong&gt; The company evolves and so do you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
